**Hostel Survey EDA - Parent Responses**

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing Hostel Survey Responses from parents. The goal of this analysis is to uncover insights about parent satisfaction with various aspects of the hostel, such as cleanliness, safety, food quality, staff behavior, and overall experience. Key steps include:

**Data Loading:** Importing the survey responses into a pandas DataFrame.
**Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, duplicates, and correcting data types.
**Descriptive Statistics:** Summarizing data with measures like mean, median, and standard deviation.
**Data Visualization:** Generating visual insights using histograms, bar plots, heatmaps, etc., to show trends and patterns in the responses.
**Feature Analysis:** Analyzing individual features like cleanliness, safety, and food quality to understand their distribution and relation to overall satisfaction.
**Correlation Analysis:** Identifying relationships between different variables to highlight key factors influencing parent satisfaction.
This EDA helps in identifying areas of improvement and understanding key factors that drive positive or negative feedback from parents.
